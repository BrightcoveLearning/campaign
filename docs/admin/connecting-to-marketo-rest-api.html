  <h1>Connecting to Marketo using the REST API</h1>
  <summary>In this topic you will learn how to configure Brightcove Campaign for use with Marketo using the REST APIs.</summary>
  <section class="bcls-section">
    <p>Brightcove Campaign can be configured to integrate with  Marketo. When the integration is configured,  video engagement data for videos published using Brightcove Campaign is  synchronized to  Marketo. Once in Marketo, this data can be used for segmentation, campaign logic, reports, lead scoring, and personalizing communications.</p>

    <h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2>
    <p>To use Brightcove Campaign with the Marketo REST integration, you must:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Create a role in Marketo which has access to all of the API permissions</li>
      <li>Create a LaunchPoint Service</li>
    </ul>
  </section>
  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="api">Creating an API-only user and LaunchPoint service</h2>
    <p>Before you can make a call to the Marketo REST API, you need to create a new API role with access to all of the APIs, create an API-only user and then create a service that uniquely identifies your client application. The steps to complete these tasks are outlined in the <a href="https://developers.marketo.com/blog/quick-start-guide-for-marketo-rest-api/">Marketo documentation</a>.</p>

      <li>Enter your <strong>Marketo REST API Endpoint URL</strong>. To get this value, in Marketo click <strong>Admin</strong> &gt; <strong>Web Services</strong>. Copy the <strong>Endpoint</strong> in the <strong>REST API</strong> section.</li>
      <li>Enter your <strong>Marketo REST API Identity URL</strong>. To get this value, in Marketo click <strong>Admin</strong> &gt;<strong> Web Services</strong>.</li>
      <li>Enter <strong>Marketo LaunchPoint Client ID</strong>. To get this value, in Marketo click <strong>Admin</strong> &gt; <strong>LaunchPoint</strong> and then click the <strong>View Details</strong> link for the LaunchPoint you created earlier as part of this setup.</li>
      <li>Enter <strong>Marketo LaunchPoint Client Secret</strong>. To get this value, in Marketo click <strong>Admin</strong> &gt;<strong> LaunchPoint</strong> and then click the <strong>View Details</strong> link for the LaunchPoint you created earlier as part of this setup.</li>
      <li>Click <strong>Save</strong>.</li>

    </ol>
    <p>The connection to Marketo is now set up and ready to use.
    By default, the <strong>Connection Status</strong> will be <strong>Enabled</strong>. The <strong>Connection Status</strong> determines if video engagement data is sent to Marketo:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Enabled</strong> - Data is collected and will be sent to Marketo</li>
          <li><strong>Disabled</strong> - No data is collected (integration is disabled)</li>
        </ul>
    <p>Click <strong>Save</strong> to save changes. To remove the integration, click <strong>Delete</strong>.</p>

  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="trackingid2">Passing a tracking ID</h2>
    <p>The Audience module supports the ability to pass a tracking ID value to Marketo. The tracking ID might be used to track a campaign ID for example. The tracking ID can be appended to the URL that displays the Audience-enabled player or added to the player embed code.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Example: Appended to URL</li>
    </ul>
    <pre>
  http://www.myurl.com/video.html?<strong>bctrackingid=12345</strong></pre>
    <ul>
      <li>Example: Added to player embed code</li>
    </ul>
    <pre>
  &lt;video data-video-id="6033402539001" 
         data-account="1486906377" 
         data-player="default" 
         data-embed="default" 
         data-application-id 
         class="video-js"
         <strong>data-bc-trackingid="12345"</strong> 
         controls&gt;&lt;/video&gt;
  &lt;script src="//players.brightcove.net/1486906377/default_default/index.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</pre>
    <p>Audience will then pass the value along to Marketo as another field that is synced.</p>
