    <p>Media sharing allows publishers to upload videos once and then share the videos to other accounts. The accounts can be your own, corporate accounts or accounts of other publishers. The shared videos can then be used independently in the other  accounts. The Media Sharing settings are used to manage the sharing relationships between accounts.</p>
    <p>This topic will use the following terminology:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Master</strong> - The account that created (uploaded) the original video. The Master owns the content and is responsible for setting up, managing and providing content to Affiliates. The Master account will always be a Brightcove Video Cloud account.</li>
      <li><strong>Affiliate</strong> - The account that is receiving the video. The Affiliate can accept content shared to it from a Master. Brightcove Campaign accounts are always affiliate accounts.</li>
    </ul>
