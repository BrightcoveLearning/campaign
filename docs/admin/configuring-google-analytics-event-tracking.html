  <h1>Configuring Google Analytics Event Tracking</h1>
  <summary>In this topic you will learn how to configure Google Analytics event tracking.</summary>
  <section class="bcls-section">
    <p>Brightcove Campaign can be configured to integrate with  Google Analytics. This allows player events and custom dimension data to be sent to a Google Analytics account for reporting purposes. Note that when the integration is configured, only analytics for video events will be passed to Google Analytics.</p>
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information language-editable">Note: Each analytics system gathers data and calculates metrics differently. Brightcove Campaign analytics data will not be identical to what appears in Google Analytics.</aside>
    <p>To configure Google Analytics integration, follow these steps:</p>
    <ol class="bcls-tasklist">
      <li>Login to Brightcove Campaign.</li>
      <li>In the navigation header, click the gear icon (<img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="" src="/demand-gen/assets/images/admin/gear-icon.png" />) and then <strong>Google Analytics</strong>.</li>
      <li>Check <strong>Enable Google Analytics</strong>.</li>
      <li>Click <strong>Sign In to Google Account</strong>.</li>
      <li>Select the Google account to sign in with and enter your credentials if prompted.</li>

      </li>
      <li>Select the <strong>Events for Tracking</strong>. See the <a href="#events">Events and custom dimensions </a> section below for a description of the events.</li>
      <li>Click <strong>Save</strong>. This will configure the player with the Google Analytics plugin and create any needed custom dimensions in your Google Analytics account.
        <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information language-editable">Note: You must have the <strong>Edit</strong> permission in your Google Analytics account in order to create dimensions.</aside>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </section>
  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="events">Events &amp; custom dimensions</h2>
    <p>Both events and custom dimension data can be passed to Google Analytics.</p>
    <figure class="bcls-figure"><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="" src="/demand-gen/assets/images/admin/google-select-events.png" /></figure>
    <p>The following events can be passed.</p>
    <h3>Basic Events</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Video Impression</strong> - Sent when a video has been loaded into a player and is ready for playback</li>
      <li><strong>Play Request</strong> - Sent when playback is initiated either by the user expressly clicking the play button, or automatically when the platform triggers playback in an auto-play scenario</li>
      <li><strong>Video Engagement</strong> - A user watched a range of seconds of a video's timeline. This event is a heartbeat for tracking video engagement and will likely be sent many times during playback, depending on the user interaction and the length of the video.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Advertising Events</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Ad Start</strong> - Sent when control is handed over to an advertising agent by the playback platform</li>
      <li><strong>Ad End</strong> - Sent when control is handed back from the advertising agent to the playback platform</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Advanced Events</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Player Load</strong> - A player session has been initiated by an end-user</li>
      <li><strong>Error</strong> - Sent when fatal errors which disrupt the playback experience are encountered</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Custom Dimensions</h3>
    <p>Custom dimensions allow you to combine Google Analytics data with non-Analytics data. Custom dimensions collect data that Google Analytics doesn't automatically track. The following custom dimensions are available.</p>
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information language-editable">Note: For more information on custom dimensions, see the <a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2709828?hl=en">Google Analytics Help</a>.</aside>
