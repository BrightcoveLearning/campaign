  <h1>Connecting to HubSpot using the REST APIs</h1>
      <summary>In this topic you will learn how to configure Brightcove Campaign for use with HubSpot using the REST APIs.</summary>

  <section class="bcls-section">
    <p>Brightcove Campaign can be configured to integrate with  HubSpot. When the integration is configured,  video engagement data for videos published using Brightcove Campaign is  synchronized to  HubSpot. Once in HubSpot, this data can be used for segmentation, campaign logic, reports, lead scoring, and personalizing communications.</p>
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information language-editable">Note: For information on how to configure Brightcove Campaign for use with HubSpot using the Client-Side APIs, see <a href="connecting-to-hubspot-client-side-api.html">Connecting to HubSpot using the Client-Side APIs</a>.</aside>
    <p>Some of the key features of the Brightcove Campaign - HubSpot integration are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Data format</strong> - Viewing data is delivered as a custom <a href="https://developers.hubspot.com/docs/methods/timeline/timeline-overview">Timeline Event Type</a>. The data that is replicated to HubSpot is as follows:
        <ul>
          <li>Video Name</li>
          <li>Video ID</li>
          <li>Brightcove Account ID</li>
          <li>Page URL of the referring page</li>
          <li>Brightcove Player ID</li>
          <li>% Watched</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Data transfer</strong> - Viewing data is sent to HubSpot using an automated process; however, some reports in the HubSpot platform may take some time to refresh</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The Video Cloud connection to HubSpot is now set up and ready to use.</p>

  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="configure">Configuring the integration</h2>
    <p>Once the Video Cloud to HubSpot connection has been made, you can configure the integration. Click <strong>HubSpot Account Info</strong> to display the connected HubSpot account info.</p>
    <div><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="connected options" src="https://img.brightcove.com/node16693-connected-options.png" /></div>
    <ol class="bcls-tasklist__restart">
      <li>By default, the <strong>Connection Status</strong> will be <strong>Enabled</strong>. The <strong>Connection Status</strong> determines if Video Cloud video engagement data is sent to HubSpot.
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Enabled</strong> - Data is collected and will be sent to HubSpot</li>
          <li><strong>Disabled</strong> - No data is collected (integration is disabled)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>By default, <strong>Track Data for Unknown Viewers</strong> will be set to <strong>Disabled</strong>. Enabling this option will track data for unknown users. Data will be retained based upon the selected data retention policy. If data retention is set to <strong>No retention</strong>, this field is not displayed.</li>
      <li>Select a data retention policy. The data retention policy determines how long the viewing data and lead form data (if using an Audience lead form) will be retained in your Video Cloud account. Retaining data in Video Cloud allows you to recover from interrupted synchronizations. Also, Audience will continue to retry events that fail to sync (usually because the viewer isn't a known contact at the time they viewed a video) until the event ages past the data retention period. <strong>You should adjust the retention settings according to your privacy policy</strong> - it is not required to retain any user data in Video Cloud.
        <div><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="data retention options" src="https://img.brightcove.com/node15636-data-retention-options.png" /></div>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>To remove the integration with HubSpot, click <strong>Disconnect</strong>. The Audience module supports multiple connections to marketing platforms. Click <strong>Add New Connection</strong> to configure additional integrations.</p>

    <h2 id="identify">Identifying viewers</h2>
    <p>For viewer tracking to occur, the viewer can be tracked in one of two ways:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>URL parameter</strong> - The user's email address can be passed in a <strong>bcemail</strong> URL parameter on the page that is displaying the video</li>
      <li><strong>HubSpot cookie</strong>- When the player loads, Audience looks to see if the user has been cookied by HubSpot already. If so, Audience will ask HubSpot if it knows who the user is via the cookie value. If HubSpot returns a contact, Audience will associate all the viewing data with that user.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>One possible scenario is to create video landing pages with a URL that’s been uniquely generated for tracking purposes. The Audience module will then use the URL parameter to look up the user server-side and sync viewing data.</p>
    <p>In order for the player/plugin to read the URL parameters, the Advanced Embed (in-page) publishing code should be used. The Standard Embed (iframe) publishing code will not work as the plugin will be running inside of an iframe and therefore is unable to access the parent page URL which has the parameter.</p>
