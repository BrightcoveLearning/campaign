    <p>Brightcove Campaign provides the ability to create lead forms which allow you to capture viewer information during video playback. Forms give you the ability to include whatever fields you need (visible or hidden) and also give you the ability to take advantage of features like progressive profiling (if available). The lead data is sent to, and processed by, Eloqua.</p>

    <h2 id="form">Creating a form in Eloqua</h2>
    <p>Eloqua provides the ability to create forms that can be used to capture viewer information. The form HTML that is generated will be used when creating a lead form inside Brightcove Campaign. The data that is captured can then be used in customizing future communications. The steps below will create a simple form to capture first name, last name and email address. For complete details on Eloqua Forms, see the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/cloud/latest/marketingcs_gs/OMCAA/Help/Forms/Forms.htm">Eloqua documentation</a>.</p>

You may need to adapt the CSS to conform to your standard colors or to handle styling of additional fields.</p>
    <div class="BCL-subsection">
      <h3>Simple form styling example</h3>
      <p>This example uses CSS to change the background color of the form to grey and the form will appear as follows:</p>
      <figure class="bcls-figure"><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="eloqua styled form" src="/assets/images/admin/eloqua-form-simple-styling.png" /></figure>
      <p>For this styling, add the following CSS to the top of the form HTML <code translate="No">style</code> tag.</p>
      <pre>
body {
      background-color: rgba(204,204,204,0.9);
      margin: 0;
      padding: 20px;
