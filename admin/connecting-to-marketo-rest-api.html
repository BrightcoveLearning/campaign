    <p>Brightcove Campaign can be configured to integrate with  Marketo. When the integration is configured,  video engagement data for videos published using Brightcove Campaign is  synchronized to  Marketo. Once in Marketo, this data can be used for segmentation, campaign logic, reports, lead scoring, and personalizing communications.</p>

    <h2 id="api">Creating an API-only user and LaunchPoint service</h2>

The steps to complete these tasks are outlined in the <a href="https://developers.marketo.com/blog/quick-start-guide-for-marketo-rest-api/">Marketo documentation</a>.</p>
