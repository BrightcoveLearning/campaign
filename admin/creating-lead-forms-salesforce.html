  <h1>Creating Lead Forms in Salesforce</h1>
  <summary>In this topic you will learn how to create a Salesforce form that can be used to capture lead data during video playback.</summary>
  <section class="bcls-section">
    <p>Brightcove Campaign provides the ability to create lead forms which allow you to capture viewer information during video playback. Forms give you the ability to include whatever fields you need (visible or hidden) and also give you the ability to take advantage of features like progressive profiling (if available). The lead data is sent to, and processed by, Salesforce. </p>

    <h2 id="form">Creating a form in Salesforce</h2>
    <p>The Web-to-Lead feature in Salesforce can be used to generate lead information from website visitors. These forms can also be displayed inside of Brightcove Campaign video players. The steps below will create a simple form to capture first name, last name, email address, company, city and state/province. For complete details on the Web-to-Lead feature, see the <a href="https://help.salesforce.com/apex/HTViewHelpDoc?id=setting_up_web-to-lead.htm&amp;language=en">Salesforce documentation</a>.</p>

    <h2 id="edit">Copying and editing the form HTML</h2>
    <p>To use the form inside of Brightcove Campaign, you will need to copy the form HTML. Also, you may want to do some basic styling to the form. In the steps below, we will copy the form HTML to an HTML editor and then make some styling changes to the form.</p>
    <p>By default, when the form is displayed, the form will display on a transparent background over the player. Use CSS to set the background color.</p>
    <ol class="bcls-tasklist-restart">
      <li class="language-editable">Copy the HTML to the clipboard.
        <figure class="bcls-figure"><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="salesforce form html" src="/assets/images/admin/salesforce-lead-form-html.png" /></figure>
      </li>
      <li class="language-editable">Click <strong>Finished</strong>.</li>
      <li class="language-editable">Paste the form HTML into your HTML editor of choice. You may want to use the code formatting feature of your editor to format the code so that it is easier to read.</li>
      <li class="language-editable">Using your HTML editor, add the following CSS to change the background color to grey.<br />
        <code>&lt;style&gt;<br />
        body {<br />
        background-color: rgba(204,204,204,0.9);<br />
        margin: 0;<br />
        padding: 20px;<br />
        height: 100%;<br />
        }<br />
        &lt;/style&gt;</code></li>
      <li class="language-editable">(Optional) To identify which leads are generated by Brightcove Campaign, the following code can be added inside the <code>&lt;form&gt;</code> tag:<br />
        <code>&lt;input type="hidden" name="lead_source" value="Brightcove Campaign"&gt;</code></li>
      <li class="language-editable">Copy the HTML to the clipboard.</li>
