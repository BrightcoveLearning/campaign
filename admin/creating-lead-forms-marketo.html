  <summary>In this topic you will learn how to create a Marketo form that can be used to capture lead data during video playback.</summary>
  <section class="bcls-section">
    <p>Brightcove Campaign provides the ability to create lead forms which allow you to capture viewer information during video playback. Forms give you the ability to include whatever fields you need (visible or hidden) and also give you the ability to take advantage of features like progressive profiling (if available). The lead data is sent to, and processed by, Marketo. </p>
