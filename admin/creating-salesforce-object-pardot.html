  <h1>Creating a Custom Salesforce Object for Pardot Integration</h1>
  <summary>In this topic you will learn how to create the Salesforce custom object that is required when using the Pardot integration.</summary>
  <section class="bcls-section">
    <p>In order to send data into the Pardot platform, it’s required that you send contact-level viewing data to your Salesforce CRM via a Custom Object. You can then use the native capabilities of Pardot and Salesforce CRM to ingest the new Custom Object into Pardot.</p>
  </section>
  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2>
    <p>To use the Salesforce - Pardot integration, you must:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>You must have the Salesforce and Pardot Connector installed and configured. Contact your Pardot Account Manager if you need assistance. </li>
      <li>You must have an available Custom Object mapping available in your Pardot account. Contact your Salesforce Account Manager if you need to purchase additional object mappings. </li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="sf-objects">Salesforce objects</h2>
    <p>Objects are database tables that allows you to store data specific to the organization in Salesforce.
      There are two type of objects in Salesforce:</p>
    <ul>
      <li> <strong>Standard Objects</strong> - 
        The objects provided by salesforce.com are called standard objects. Examples of standard objects are Accounts, Contacts, Opportunities, Leads, Products, Campaigns, Cases, Users, Contracts, Reports, and Dashboards</li>
      <li><strong>Custom Object</strong> - 
        The objects created by  users are called custom objects. Custom objects store information that is unique and important to your organization and provide a structure for sharing data.
        Video viewing data can be sent from Brightcove Players to Salesforce using custom objects. Different fields with different data types can be added to the object. A lookup relationship essentially links two objects together so that you can “look up” one object from the related items on another object. We can create a look up relationship between the custom object and a Contact.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="object-creation">Creating a custom object</h2>
    <p>Contacts are the users whose behavior you wish to track or keep records in Salesforce. There should be a relationship between the custom object that is created above and the Contact object in order to get data related to the correct user. To create this unique object, follow these steps:</p>

    <h2 id="configuredata">Configuring data mapping</h2>
    <p>Data mapping determines how video data is mapped to fields in a Salesforce object. By default, the integration will be configured using <strong>Simple</strong> mapping which maps some video data to the <strong>Task</strong> object in Salesforce.</p>
    <figure class="bcls-figure"><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="salesforce mappping type" src="/assets/images/admin/salesforce-simple-mapping.png" /></figure>
    <p>Follow these steps to customize the data mapping.</p>
    <ol class="bcls-tasklist-restart">
      <li>For the <strong>Mapping Type</strong>, select <strong>Advanced</strong>.</li>
      <li>In the <strong>Salesforce Object</strong> dropdown list, select a Salesforce object to map the video data to.</li>
      <li>Map the appropriate <strong>View Field</strong> to Salesforce fields.

      </li>
      <li>Click <strong>Save</strong> to save the changes.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>To remove the integration with Salesforce, click <strong>Delete</strong>.</p>

    <h2 id="trackingid2">Passing a tracking ID</h2>
    <p>Brightcove Campaign supports the ability to pass a tracking ID value to Salesforce. The tracking ID might be used to track a campaign ID for example. The tracking ID can be appended to the page URL that displays the video  or added to the  embed code.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Example: Appended to URL</li>
    </ul>
    <pre>
  http://www.myurl.com/video.html?<strong>bctrackingid=12345</strong></pre>
    <ul>
      <li>Example: Added to player embed code</li>
    </ul>
    <pre>
  &lt;video data-video-id="6033402539001" 
         data-account="1486906377" 
         data-player="default" 
         data-embed="default" 
         data-application-id 
         class="video-js"
         <strong>data-bc-trackingid="12345"</strong> 
         controls&gt;&lt;/video&gt;
  &lt;script src="//players.brightcove.net/1486906377/default_default/index.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</pre>
    <p>Brightcove Campaign will then pass the value along to Salesforce as another field that is synced.</p>
  </section>
  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="identify">Identifying viewers</h2>
    <p>If your Salesforce connection is configured with a <strong>Manual</strong> integration type, it's up to you to identify viewers. For viewer tracking to occur, the user id should be passed as a URL parameter on the page that is displaying the video. Two URL parameters are supported:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>bcemail</strong> - To pass the viewer's email address</li>
      <li><strong>bcsfid</strong> - To pass the viewer's Salesforce ID</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In this scenario, video landing pages would be generated with a URL that’s been uniquely generated for tracking purposes. Brightcove Campaign will then use the URL parameter to look up the user server-side and sync viewing data. </p>
  </section>
  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="sfdata">Viewing video data in Salesforce</h2>
    <p>As videos are viewed, video viewing data will be synced to Salesforce. If the <strong>Simple</strong> data mapping option was selected, video view data will appear as a <strong>Task</strong> entry inside Salesforce. If the <strong>Advanced</strong> data mapping option was used, viewing data will appear as part of the Salesforce object that was selecting when the mapping was configured. In the following example, <strong>Simple</strong> data mapping was used. Viewing data appears as part of the contact's <strong>Activity History</strong>. The <strong>Subject</strong> will display <strong>BC Video View</strong> along with the video name and percent watched.</p>

    <p>Clicking the <strong>Task</strong> will display additional information in the <strong>Comments</strong> field.</p>
