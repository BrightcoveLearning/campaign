    <h2 id="datetime">Basic Dashboard</h2>
    <p>The Basic Dashboard will provide an overview of the best and worst performing videos in the account. Graphs display the number of video impressions, video starts, avg. percent viewed and avg. time viewed. This dashboard does not provide a Video Benchmark Score (VBS) for each video and is unable to compare the performance of your videos to the performance of other, similar videos of the same type. To enable the VBS and comparative analytics, enable the <strong>Video Content Type</strong> metadata field for videos. This setting can be enabled as part of the <a href="../admin/managing_account_settings.html#account_settings">account settings</a>.</p>
