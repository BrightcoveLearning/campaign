    <p>Brightcove Campaign will display an advanced dashboard when the Video Content Type metadata field for videos has been enabled. The advanced dashboard provides a Video Benchmark Score (VBS) for each video which compares the performance of your videos to the performance of other, similar videos of the same type.</p>
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Note: Brightcove recommends enabling the Video Content Type field and then using the advanced dashboard.</aside>
    <p>To view the Dashboard page, click <strong>Dashboard</strong> in the navigation header.</p>

    <h2 id="timespan" class="BCL_conceptTitle">Selecting a time span</h2>
    <p>To specify the time period for the dashboard, you can click on a quick date or use the calendar control.</p>
    <h3>Using a quick date</h3>
    <p>A series of quick dates are at the top of the page. The following quick dates are available:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Today</li>
      <li>Yesterday</li>
      <li>Last 7 days</li>
      <li>Last 30 days</li>
      <li>This month - The calendar month to date - for example, if today is March 17, this report will display March 1 - March 17</li>
      <li>Last month - The previous calendar month - for example, if today is February 14, this report will display January 1 - January 31.</li>
    </ul>
    <figure class="bcls-figure"><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="quick dates" src="/assets/images/dashboard/dashboard-quick-dates.png" /></figure>
    <p>Click on a quick date to update the dashboard.</p>
    <h3>Using the calendar control</h3>
    <p>You can also select a start and end dates by clicking on the calendar control.</p>
    <figure class="bcls-figure"><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="date selector" src="/assets/images/dashboard/dashboard-calendar-control.png" /></figure>
    <p>Click <strong>Apply</strong> to update the dashboard.</p>
    <h3>Reporting time zone</h3>
    <p>Data in the dashboard  is shown using the account's reporting time zone. The time zone is displayed below the calendar control.</p>
    <figure class="bcls-figure"><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="time zone" src="/assets/images/dashboard/dashboard-time-zone.png" /></figure>
    <p>The reporting time zone is used to calculate day boundaries for reporting data. Changing the reporting time zone setting only affects data going forward, and changes are not applied retroactively. If you change this setting, you may see a flat spot or a spike in your data when looking at day boundaries where the change was applied. Updates to this setting may not take effect immediately, and analytics data may continue to refer to the old setting until the system processes the changes.</p>
    <p>The reporting time zone can be configured as part of the <a href="/admin/managing-account-settings.html#account_settings">account settings</a>. </p>
