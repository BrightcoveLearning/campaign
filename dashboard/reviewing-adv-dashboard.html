  <h1>Reviewing the Advanced Dashboard</h1>
  <summary>In this topic you will learn about the information presented in the Advanced Dashboard.</summary>
  <section class="bcls-section">
    <p>The Advanced Dashboard provides an overview of the best and worst performing videos in the account. If there are less than 10 videos in the account, only 10 best performing video will be displayed. This dashboard provides a Video Benchmark Score (VBS) for each video. The VBS compares the performance of your videos to the performance of other, similar videos of the same type. The Advanced Dashboard is only displayed when the Video Content Type metadata field for videos has been enabled.</p>

    <h2 id="timespan" class="BCL_conceptTitle">Selecting a time span</h2>
    <p>To specify the time period for the dashboard, you can click on a quick date or use the calendar control.</p>
    <h3>Using a quick date</h3>
    <p>A series of quick dates are at the top of the page. The following quick dates are available:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Today</li>
      <li>Yesterday</li>
      <li>Last 7 days</li>
      <li>Last 30 days</li>
      <li>This month - The calendar month to date - for example, if today is March 17, this report will display March 1 - March 17</li>
      <li>Last month - The previous calendar month - for example, if today is February 14, this report will display January 1 - January 31.</li>
    </ul>
    <figure class="bcls-figure"><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="quick dates" src="/assets/images/dashboard/dashboard-quick-dates.png" /></figure>
    <p>Click on a quick date to update the dashboard.</p>
    <h3>Using the calendar control</h3>
    <p>You can also select a start and end dates by clicking on the calendar control.</p>
    <figure class="bcls-figure"><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="date selector" src="/assets/images/dashboard/dashboard-calendar-control.png" /></figure>
    <p>Click <strong>Apply</strong> to update the dashboard.</p>
    <h3>Reporting time zone</h3>
    <p>Data in the dashboard  is shown using the account's reporting time zone. The time zone is displayed below the calendar control.</p>
    <figure class="bcls-figure"><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="time zone" src="/assets/images/dashboard/dashboard-time-zone.png" /></figure>
    <p>The reporting time zone is used to calculate day boundaries for reporting data. Changing the reporting time zone setting only affects data going forward, and changes are not applied retroactively. If you change this setting, you may see a flat spot or a spike in your data when looking at day boundaries where the change was applied. Updates to this setting may not take effect immediately, and analytics data may continue to refer to the old setting until the system processes the changes.</p>
    <p>The reporting time zone can be configured as part of the <a href="file:///Macintosh HD/private/var/folders/x9/6htkrrb16s3gfz3j3dd3p9d40000gn/T/TemporaryItems/Adobe/admin/managing_account_settings.html#account_settings">account settings</a>. </p>
