<section class="bcls-section">
  <p>The Publish feature in Brightcove Campaign&trade; can be used to easily generate the embed code and images needed to distribute a video using a marketing automation platform (MAP). Typically, the embed  code is pasted into an HTML landing page created in a MAP and then a link to the landing page is sent via email.</p>

    <li>Copy the <strong>Video SEO Code</strong> and paste the code between the <code translate="No">&lt;head&gt;</code> and <code translate="No">&lt;/head&gt;</code> tags on your landing page. The Video SEO Code will help improve the visibility of the landing page to search engines.
      After your page is published, Google provides a <a href="https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/9012289">URL Inspection Tool</a> which can be used to 
      see detailed Google Index information about a URL on your site.

  <h2 id="copy-poster">Copying the poster image</h2>
  <p>On most platforms, embedding videos directly into email isn&rsquo;t possible. This isn't a Brightcove limitation, nearly every modern email system will strip out video player embed code due to security reasons. We can however, drive awareness and traffic for content by creating an email with some teaser text and a poster image. The poster image will look like a video player and be a clickable link that redirects to the video landing page.</p>
  <p>To copy the poster image for a video, follow these steps:</p>
  <ol class="bcls-tasklist-restart">
    <li>Click the <strong>Email</strong> tab at top of the page.</li>
    <li>Click <strong>Copy</strong> to copy the poster image.
      <figure class="bcls-figure"><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="select player" src="/assets/images/videos/publish-poster-image.png" /></figure>
    </li>
    <li>Paste the image into the tool that will be sending the email.</li>
    <li>Create a hyperlink from the image to the landing page with the published video.</li>
  </ol>
